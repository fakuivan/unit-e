# ``unit_e``s symbolic units with numerical calculations

This module augments the utility of Sympy's symbolic units by providing a way
to convert them into regular ``float``s, ``complex``es or any other numerical
quantity while still preserving a notion of unit correctness on the produced results.
Heavily inspired in the much simpler
[numericalunits](https://pypi.org/project/numericalunits/) package.
